# Strengthen SSH

-Went to etc/ssh/sshd_config and set password login and root user login to "no" and public key auth to yes

-Already set up a keypair when i made the aws instance

-Added my linux id_rsa to the servers ssh and turned off all other login points.

-Simply added my key to the authorized file in the .ssh (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)

-Now I can connect with ssh ~ubuntu@65.0.7.234~ ubuntu@13.235.82.67

# fail2ban

- sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local‚Äç - to make a copy cos the main conf says not to modify it

- sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

[sshd]
