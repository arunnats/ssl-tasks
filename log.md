# Arun's SSL Induction Log

## Prereqs

-Set up AWS instance

-Public ip : ~65.0.7.234~ 13.235.82.67 (Lost the first one cos i set the ip to my own but then my router restarted so its gone lmao)

-Private ip : 172.31.8.134

-No elastic ip so do not turn it off

-keypair saved "ssl-<redacted>.pem"

-keypair protected with "$ chmod 400"

## Setting up VM

-~Accessed VM with "$ ssh -i ./ssl-<redacted>.pem ubuntu@65.0.7.234"~
-~Accessed VM with "$ ssh -i ./ssl-<redacted>.pem ubuntu@13.235.82.67"~

-sudo apt updated and upgraded

# Unattended Packages

-Set up unattended packages with "sudo apt install unattended-upgrades"

-Unattended upgrades keeps the system up to date with the most recent security upgrades

-"$apt-get install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges"

-"$lsb_release -c" to get the codename " Noble "

-Navigated to "etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades"

-Used nano to set up the package lists to ubuntu@noble and turned on settings for :

- "Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins {"ubuntu:noble-security";};"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Allow-APT-Mark-Fallback "true";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Skip-Updates-On-Metered-Connections "false";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::OnlyOnACPower "false";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies "true";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-New-Unused-Dependencies "true";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Kernel-Packages "true";"
- "Unattended-Upgrade::AutoFixInterruptedDpkg "true";"

-Navigated to "sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades"

-Used nano to set up these

- APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
- APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
- APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";
- APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";

- The numeric values indicate the number of days between each action

-Activated unattended packages with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades" & "sudo systemctl restart unattended-upgrades.service"

# Strengthen SSH

-Went to etc/ssh/sshd_config and set password login and root user login to "no" and public key auth to yes

-Already set up a keypair when i made the aws instance

-Added my linux id_rsa to the servers ssh and turned off all other login points.

-Simply added my key to the authorized file in the .ssh (~/.ssh/authorized_keys)

-Now I can connect with ssh ~ubuntu@65.0.7.234~ ubuntu@13.235.82.67

-added ssl's key
"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAASSSSSSSSSSSfgjmclM0fbj/K/NYqNcfNovc0GDztI+LQwGuP6Z+P8XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXkpfRp8vu8oh8epvqFICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCcserver"

# fail2ban

-Setup fail2ban, downloaded it from apt and set the max tries to 5 and ban time to 10 mins

- sudo apt install fail2ban
- sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local‚Äç - to make a copy cos the main conf says not to modify it

- sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

- set these setting:

[default]
maxretry = 3
findtime = 600
bantime = 3600

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log

- sudo systemctl enable fail2ban && sudo systemctl start fail2ban

- doesnt work wtf

- [BR]: ERROR No module named 'asynchat' on Ubuntu 24.04

- ubuntu 24.04 doesnt support the newest version of python, found a script to fix it on github

-ran script (https://github.com/alexdcodes/ConfigureUbuntu/blob/main/fail2ban/install.sh)
-worked

-made above changes

-should work now

# ufw

- sudo apt-get install ufw - it was already there

- sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
- sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
- sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
- sudo ufw default deny incoming
- sudo ufw default allow outgoing
- sudo ufw enable

sudo ufw status
Status: active

- but this stops me from ssh-ing in
- so sudo ufw allow ssh

-works

## ufw logging

-sudo ufw logging medium
-sudo ufw status verbose

- didnt work cos my whole logging this had an error so i "sudo service rsyslog restart" and it works

# Sidequest

- ssh was being a nuisance so i did sudo apt install openssh
- kinda works now but had to go and redo the whole ssh config

- tried to set up zsh cos i hate bash but chsh asks for a password which then says pam auth failed. gotta ask around

- pam is prolly the reason i cant chsh i gotta fix that

- tried changind the chsh file in pam.d but didnt work

- ended up just adding zsh to the end of bashrc (lifehax) and figlet for a nice welcome message

- got oh my zsh and copied some of my plugins over. life is better now

# Google 2fa

- i tried this on the other vm i made before i got locked out and it asked for password even after verification code, tried again here

- sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator

- ran google-authenticator and set it up with the qr code and the app

-added teh following to /etc/pam.d/sshd
'''
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so nullok
auth required pam_permit.so
'''

- added "ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes" and to etc/ssh/sshd_config and restarted ssh

- added "AuthenticationMethods publickey,password publickey,keyboard-interactive" to the ssd_config

- commented out the following in the pam.d config

'''

# Standard Un\*x authentication.

#@include common-auth
'''
